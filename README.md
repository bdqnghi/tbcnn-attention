## An implementation of Tree-based Convolutional Neural Network (TBCNN) in Tensorflow

This is a Tensorflow implementation of the Tree-based Convolutional Neural Network (TBCNN) as described in the paper [Convolutional Neural Networks over Tree Structures for Programming Language Processingks, AAAI 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5718).

Our reproduced results are much better than the results reported in the original paper. Concretely, we could get up to 97.5% in F1 score (compared to 94% reported in the original paper)
